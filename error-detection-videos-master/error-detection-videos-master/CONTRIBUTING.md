# How to contribute

This repo is a bit different than most open-source projects because its primary purpose is to accompany a series of YouTube videos.

## Submitting changes

With few exceptions, I won't merge pull requests. That's so the code in this repo matches what people will see in the videos. It's definitely not because the code can't be improvedâ€”it certainly can.

But that's not meant to discourage pull requests! If you've got suggestions or improvements, please open a pull request. I'll leave non-duplicate PRs open so others can browse, discuss, and draw inspiration from them.

There are a few execptions where I will merge PRs:

  * Any case where the repo doesn't match what's in the videos.
  * Fixing mistakes in documentation files.
  * Rare cases where there's a truly fatal bug of the sort where it's a miracle it worked at all in the video.
